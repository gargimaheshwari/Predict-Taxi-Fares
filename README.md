# Predicting Taxi Fares Using Random Forests

In this R notebook, I use random forests to predict taxi fares across Manhattan. Data is taken from kaggle.com - [2015 NYC taxi trips](https://www.kaggle.com/dhimananubhav/2015-nyc-taxi-trips-subset-12-million-rows#2015-12_100k.csv).

I also use ggmap and ggplot for visualizations.
